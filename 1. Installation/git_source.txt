This is step by step tutorial to installing golang from git source

1. The steps below are shown at: https://golang.org/doc/install/source

2. Clone the go's repository: git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go

3. Change active dir to cloned repository: cd go

4. See the current branch: git branch

5. See all the release branch: git branch -a

6. Checkout to any version of golang that you want: git checkout release-branch.go1.11

7. Change active dir to src, so we can install Go Distribution: cd src

8. Run the command which has created: ./all.bash
   if you had something wrong like this
   ERROR: Cannot find /home/adithyavisnu/go1.4/bin/go.
   that means you have not installed the go bootstrap from scratch, so you should do:
   - see the download page on : https://golang.org/dl/
     and pick a version you do want to become a base compiler for installing via github. 
   - download the go1.xx.xx.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   - extract to your profile folder. eg. /home/adithyvisnu and rename to go1.4. so the folder could be /home/adithyavisnu/go1.4 and has a bin folder.

9. Back to clonned git repository of go and change dir to src

10. Run the command ./all.bash once again. If the test runs failed, then you should try a different release branches.

11. After all those test passed you will have to registry the go source to your PATH.

12. The things can be tested
